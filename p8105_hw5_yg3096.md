## Problem 1

``` r
check <- function(n) {
         any(duplicated(sample.int(365, size = n, replace = TRUE)))
}

# For group size of 2-50, run simulation 10000 times for each size
n_size <- 2:50
prob <- numeric(length(n_size))

for (i in seq_along(n_size)) {
    n <- n_size[i]
    prob[i] <- mean(replicate(10000, check(n)))
}
sim <- data.frame(n = n_size, prob = prob)

# Plot showing probability and group size
sim |>
    ggplot(aes(x = n, y = prob)) + geom_line() + geom_point() +
    geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5) +
    labs(title = "Probability that people have duplicate birthday", 
         x = "Group size (n)", y = "Estimated probability")  
```

The probability of more than one people share the same birthday
increases  
rapidly as group size grows, and this probability exceeds 50% at group
size of  
around 23.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
