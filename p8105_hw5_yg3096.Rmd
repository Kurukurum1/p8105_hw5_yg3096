## Problem 1
```{r}
check <- function(n) {
         any(duplicated(sample.int(365, size = n, replace = TRUE)))
}

# For group size of 2-50, run simulation 10000 times for each size
n_size <- 2:50
prob <- numeric(length(n_size))
for (i in seq_along(n_size)) {
    n <- n_size[i]
    prob[i] <- mean(replicate(10000, check(n)))
}
sim <- data.frame(n = n_size, prob = prob)

# Plot showing probability and group size
sim |>
    ggplot(aes(x = n, y = prob)) + geom_line() + geom_point() +
    geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5) +
    labs(title = "Probability that people have duplicate birthday", 
         x = "Group size (n)", y = "Estimated probability")
```

The probability of more than one people share the same birthday increases  
rapidly as group size grows, and this probability exceeds 50% at group size of  
around 23.

## Problem 2
```{r}
n <- 30
sigma <- 5
n_mu <- 0:6
alpha <- 0.05

# Simulation for a certain mu_true, return estimate and p-value
simulate <- function(mu_true) {
            x <- rnorm(n, mean = mu_true, sd = sigma)
            tt <- t.test(x, mu = 0)
            c(estimate = unname(tt$estimate), p.value = tt$p.value, 
              mu_true = mu_true)
}

# Simulation for all mu_true
result_list <- vector("list", length(n_mu))
for (i in seq_along(n_mu)) {
    mu <- n_mu[i]
    one_mu <- replicate(5000, simulate(mu), simplify = FALSE)
    result_list[[i]] <- bind_rows(one_mu)
}
# 7*5000 rows with 3 columns, estimate, p-value and mu_true 
sim_raw <- bind_rows(result_list)

# Calculate power
power_df <- sim_raw |>
            group_by(mu_true) |>
            summarise(power = mean(p.value < alpha), .groups = "drop")

# Calculate estimate mean
estimate_df <- sim_raw |>
               group_by(mu_true) |>
               summarise(mean_est = mean(estimate), 
                         mean_est_reject = mean(estimate[p.value < alpha]),
                         .groups = "drop")

# Plot of power and true mean
power_df |>
         ggplot(aes(x = mu_true, y = power)) + geom_line() + geom_point() +
         labs(title = "Power and true mean (one-sample t, n=30, σ=5)",
              x = "True mean (μ)", y = "Power")
```

In general the power of test increases as the effect size grows. When the effect    
size is 1, the power is about 0.2, and increases significantly as the effect    
size grows. For the effect size of 4, 5 and 6, the power is close to 1 and     
increase of power became minimal.  

```{r}
# Calculate mean in all sample and rejected sample
estimate_long <- estimate_df |>
                 pivot_longer(cols = c(mean_est, mean_est_reject), 
                              names_to = "type", values_to = "mean_hat") |>
                 mutate(type = recode(type, mean_est = "All samples",
                                      mean_est_reject = "Only rejections"))

# Plot of average estimate of sample mean and true mean
estimate_long |>
              ggplot(aes(x = mu_true, y = mean_hat, color = type)) +
              geom_line() + geom_point() + 
              labs(title = "Average estimate (n = 30, σ = 5, α = 0.05)",
                   x = "True mean (μ)", y = "Average of μ_hat") +
              theme(legend.title = element_blank())
```

When μ is small (1 or 2), the sample average of μ_hat for those the null is   
rejected is generally greater than the true value of μ, and as the value of μ  
increases, the sample average of μ_hat converges to the true value of μ. This is  
because the bias in selection, when take estimates only in rejections, μ_hat  
with greater absolute value will tend to be selected, thus the result is  
generally greater than the true value of μ, when μ and power increases, more  
samples become significant, the difference converges to 0.
